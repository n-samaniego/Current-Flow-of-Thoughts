  Hello! My name is Niles Samaniego, and here on my blog, I'll be sharing updates on my work, insights into my creative processes, and my professional milestones. Over the next few posts, I'll be writing about the thing's I've done in the past. There is *a lot* of things that I've done that I think deserve to be reflected on and archived, and so, this is my attempt at doing just that. 
  
  The reason for starting to do this is... kinda silly. I want my work to be remembered. ***I** want to be remembered.* Not that I'll be super famous one day, not that my work is so outstanding that it deserves to be adverised to an audience, but I simply wish to carve out a small piece of the infinite internet for myself. A quaint little place where I can share my thoughts and my battles, almost like a journal. What's the difference between this and a diary? Honestly, nothing much! But now, it's out on the web, and as long as GitHub exists (while it doesn't *quite* sit right with me that I'm relying on external hosting, it makes it easy!) my story will exist in one form or another. It calms the little "existential crisis worm" eating me from the inside, that's all. 
  
  I hope you'll enjoy your time here! Everything here is meant to be easy and interesting to read; it's a look into the mind of a (future) Electrical Engineer, story writer, chess player. I think that honestly covers a range of different people, and so I hope everyone can take a little something from checking this all out. In any case, I'm ending this first post here and writing the next one right away!

  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year :)
